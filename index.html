		Tyler is a very cautious man. Aware of his powers, Tyler works to conceal his abilities as he is very aware of what he could do if he let the storm within him go. As such, he is very emotionally disciplined, able to keep a positive demeanor when happy and stoic when upset.
<br><br>
Due to his time with the Witcher School of the Griffin, Tyler finds himself strongly believing in the traditional values of Honor and Virtue, values associated with the Griffin School. In his time training under the tutelage of the famed Witcher Raven, Tyler found himself typically caring for all beings of sentience, provided that they are not dishonorable and good to other sentient beings. Despite this, however, he does not mind killing another sentient being in the act of self defense or in the defense of an innocent party. As a multiversal traveler trained as a Witcher, Tyler does not mind doing dirty, yet honest work for money. Unlike the Witchers, Tyler greatly believes in meddling with political affairs - if only to prevent harm coming upon innocent sentient beings. 
<br><br>
In his travels, Tyler often ends up helping ruined worlds and peoples, guiding them back into prosperity. At one point, someone unknown titled Tyler the 'Navigator,' which he adopted after learning that names have power as a method to conceal his own name. Despite this, he loathes the elusive and self-titled 'Queen of Darkness,' as she has often left hints that she is responsible for the fall of worlds and civilizations. He also find's the Queen's title cringe.

		Tyler is a fair man of a lean build. With messy black hair and brown eyes, Tyler ususally keeps his attire simple. He keeps a blue hoodie, his sword strapped to his back, gray cargo pants and combat boots to cover his feet. He does have a notable scar over his right hand that depicts the Glyph for the Witcher Sign Ignii. <br><br>

			<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">PHYSICAL PROWESS AND TRAITS</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				Since Tyler left the Griffin School before comitting to becoming a full blown Witcher, Tyler did not undergo the process to physicially mutate into a Witcher. As such, Tyler reetains the senses and physical ability of a very athletic human instead of a Witcher's. However, for a normal human, Tyler's strength and endurance is very high, as he is able to fight monsters and even once bested a dragon in single combat.

			<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">MARTIAL ARTS</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				With his Witcher Training, Tyler is a very capable fighter. He has mastered sever hand-to-hand combat martial arts, along with Witcher-styled swordsmanship. Witcher swordsman ship heavily focuses on remaining offensive and only being defensive at a last stance. The Witcher School of the Griffin adds onto this by training members to be able to fight entire crowds of people at once, making Tyler a very capapble foe even with faced against multiple opponents.

			<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">WITCHER SIGNS</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				Witchers are trained to fight using multiple simple spells that can be cast with single-handed hand signs or drawn glyphs. These simple spells are known as Witcher Signs. <details><summary class="section-head">The Witcher Signs are as follows:</summary><ul>
<li> Aard: a simple magical sign used by witchers. The Aard sign is a simple magical sign used by witchers that directs a blast of telekinetic energy to stagger opponents, leaving them open for a subsequent attack. Aard can also blow out any existing fires, blast open poorly secured doors, or punch through cracked or damaged walls. Aard's alternate form turns it into a bubble of telekinetic energy that focuses around the witcher and expands outward with destructive force.
<li> Igni: one of five simple magical signs used by witchers and causes a burst of fire that can repel and ignite opponents, as well as start fires. Igni's alternate form turns the burst of fire into a sustained stream of sparks and flames.
<li> Quen: a simple magical sign used by witchers that forms a protective field around the caster. Quen's basic ability is to cover a witcher in a basic shield that absorbs a limited amount of damage. Quen's alternate form creates a bubble of protective energy to form around the witcher it is stronger than the original form but is more draining on the witcher and requires them to remain in place.
<li> Yrden: a simple magical sign used by witchers that forms a circular, magical trap. The trap triggers a certain number of times when traversed by a foe, causing knock back, damage, and a chance of inflicting ailments on its targets Most foes that wander into the ring are significantly slowed, though some monsters are unaffected by it. Yrden is one of the witchers best tools for controlling multiple enemies in melee range. It's also particularly valuable for witchers when up against noonwraiths and nightwraiths, who remain incorporeal most of the time unless caught within a Yrden circle. Yrden's alternate form creates a stationary glyph of magical energy that strikes at and slows down hostile forces within a certain radius, as well as destroys and projectiles that happen to pass through that radius. Multiple Magic Traps can be placed down at once by experienced witchers.
<li> Axii: a sign that can charm an opponent's mind to stun them, temporarily eliminating them from combat. However, the stun effect disappears after seven seconds or when the target receives harm. This sign can be used by witchers to calm their mounts or on people to gain information or benefits. This sign can usually only affect one person at a time and its effects are visible to other people in the vicinity. Axii's alternate sign forces an enemy to temporarily become an ally and fight on your side during a conflict for a short time as well as boosting their physical abilities for the duration of the conversion.
<li> Hatri: a telempathic sign which reflects the opponent's hate, bloodlust and hunger back to its source, making the monster afraid.
<li> Heliotrop: a magical sign used by witchers. It is made by crossing one's wrists, and works as a buffer against physical attacks, combat magic and impacts with walls, ground etc. Contrary to Quen, which is active until broken or dispelled, the Heliotrop is active only for a moment and cushions from a single powerful attack or damage.
<li> Supirre: a Sign used for eavesdropping. Drawn on a solid surface, it allows the people near this surface to listen nearby conversations which would be normally inaudible due to the distance or background noise.
<li> Somni: a simple magicalsign used by witchers. It is used to put the target to sleep, and may possibly also leave them open to some form of suggestion.
<li> Shadi: a Sign developed by the School of the Griffin. It is used to temporarily turn its caster intangible, the user can specify whether they fall through the ground as well, allowing for better mobility and the ability to avoid being trapped or barricaded against ones will. Shadi's alternate form is able to cloak a witcher in a field of light refractive magic rendering the witcher temporary invisbile to human sight. It does not negate scent, sound, or any of the other senses.
<li> Volun: a Sign developed by the School of the Griffin. It is used to shoot bolts of plasma/lightning from the witcher's fingertips, it is an effective scare tactic tool when dealing with peasant mobs. And is an effective weapon against armored enemies. Volun's alternate form is able to shoot a sustained bolt of lightning controlled by the witcher that can jump from enemy to enemy, the more skilled the witcher the more targets it can hit.
<li> Vorg: a Sign developed by the School of the Griffin. It is similar to the Quen spell but is more specialized as it creates a barrier that the witcher can walk away from. Useful for blocking narrow passages or creating choke points to deal with group combat easier. Vorg's alternate form forms a glowing line or boundary where the witcher points after casting the hand sign then tracing the line, the boundary has an effect like Aard that telekinetic throws anything that comes into contact with it that the witcher deems hostile.
<li> Vintyr: a Sign developed by the School of the Griffin. It is the antithesis of the Igni sign, rapidly cooling or even freezing anything the witcher touches while using the sign or in the cold wave radius. Vintyr alternate form shoots a sustained stream of cold air and ice, rapidly freezing whatever it hits.
<li> Moahk: a Sign developed by the School of the Griffin. It is capable of magically creating water, or shooting a wave of water at a target. A good preparation sign to use before Volun. Witchers can use this sign in survival scenarios like in the desert to conjure water. Moahk's alternate form blasts a forceful torrent of water from the witcher's hand, the pressure can be adjusted by focusing more magic through the Sign. It can be used as a peasant mob deterrant, to put out fires or with enough skill and magic poured into it to cut through objects.

			<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">WIZARDING SPELLS</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				In his travels, Tyler has learned a secondary way to harness his magic. Using Witcher Signs, Tyler is capable of casting wordless iand simple spells, relying on his pure magic control and intent. Conversely, Tyler was once taught as a student of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, being a member of the school house Thunderbird. The magic he was taught there must be spoken and channeled through a magical artifact in order to cast a spell, which waqs typically a wand. While Tyler possesses no traditional wand, the bracelet on Tyler's left wrist acts as a subsitute, being made up of Elder Wood with a dragon heartstring core. Due to the components of the bracelet, Tyler can cast more complex spells through his bracelet. <details><summary class="section-head">The spells Tyler can cast are as follows:</summary><ul>
<li>Accio: Summons an object towards the caster. It is able to summon objects in direct line of sight of the caster, as well as things out of view, by calling the object aloud after the incantation. This spell needs thought behind it, and the object must be clear in the casters mind before trying to summon it. The caster doesn't necessarily need to know the location of the target if they say the name of the object to be summoned. The Summoning Charm is unable to directly summon exceptionally large targets such as buildings, or living creatures (except for Flobberworms which aren't considered to be worth summoning). It is, however, possible to move a creature by summoning things they are wearing or holding. It is also possible to bewitch items to become unaffected from this charm, as is the case with most bought goods.
<li>Alohomora: Unlocks doors and other locked objects. It can also unlock doors that have been sealed with a Locking Spell, although it is possible to bewitch doors to become unaffected by this spell.
<li>Arresto Momentum: Greatly reduces the kinectic force of an object or person - only works on one target.
<li>Ascendio: A simple ascension charm with lifts the user up into the air. This spell also works underwater.
<li>Confringo: A fiery bolt is summoned, seeking out the intended target. Deals a bit of damage on impact.
<li>Colloportus: A simple lockign spell. It can lock doors and other locks.
<li>Descendo: Slams a person or object to the ground, cuaisng considerable impact damage. On bigger foes, this spell simply acts as a heavy weight.
<li>Diffindo: A slicing spell that slices a single non-magically protected target.
<li>Expelliarmus: Causes an individual to drop a held item - works well for disarming.
<li>Protego: Creates a shield bubble much more powerful than the Witcher Sign Quen, but less powerful than Helitrop.
<li>Levioso: Causes a target to float - only works on one target.
<li>Lumos: Conjures an orb of light. Ordinarily at the tip of a wand, the ball of light produced by Lumos is a simple sphere in Tyler's palm.
<li>Stupefy: A stunning spell.

<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">ANCIENT MAGIC</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				In his time as a student of Ilvermorny, Tyler discovered that he was able to see traces of a magic unknown. He finds himself able to loosely tap into this magic - the magic being tied to his emotions. So far, he is simply able to call lightning strikes without uttering a spell.
			</blockquote><br>

			<b style="font-size:10px;letter-spacing:2px;">THE SOURCE WITHIN</b>
			<blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #000000;padding:0 0 0 10px;">
				Not much is understood about the power lurking within Tyler. Most refer to it as a "Source." In essence, Tyler is a big battery filled up with raw magical energy - and he has a lot of it. It is this Source within him that allows him to phase through the Multiverse and travel. Tyler describes the Source within him as a storm within him that must be constantly kept at check. The Source is highly reactive to Tyler's emotions. Tyler suspects there is much more to the Source than what he has experienced so far.
